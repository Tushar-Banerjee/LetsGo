					<div class="col-xs-9">
					<p>The dish was developed in the 1950s by three Punjabi restaurateurs: Kundan Lal Gujral, Kundan Lal Jaggi and Thakur Dass, who were the founders of Moti Mahal restaurant in Delhi, India. The dish was made "by chance" by mixing the leftover chicken in a tomato gravy, rich in butter and cream</p>
<p>Chicken is marinated for several hours in a lemon juice, dahi (yogurt) and a mixture of Kashmiri red chilli, salt, garam masala and ginger garlic paste.

The chicken is usually cooked in a tandoor (traditional clay oven), but may be grilled, roasted, or pan-fried. It is served in a mild curry sauce that includes butter. The sauce is a tomato- and onion-based sauce that is simmered until smooth and much of the water has evaporated. There are many variations on the composition and spicing of the sauce, which is sieved so that it is finally velvety smooth. Spices may include cardamom, cumin, cloves, cinnamon, coriander, pepper, garam masala and fenugreek (Punjabi/Hindi: kasuri methi). Cream may be used in the sauce or as a garnish. Cashew paste may be used as a thickener and is finally garnished with cilantro</p>

					<p>Dal baati is an Indian dish of dal and baati (hard wheat rolls).It is popular in Rajasthan, Uttar Pradesh and Madhya Pradesh (especially in Braj, Nimar and Malwa regions).Dal is prepared using tuvaar dal, chana dal (prepared by removing skin of split chickpeas), mung dal, moth dal, or urad dal. The pulses or lentils are cooked together after being soaked in water for a few hours. First, a small amount of vegetable oil is heated in a frying pan and then the seasoning rai-jeera (mustard and cumin seeds) is added into the hot oil. Then green chilli, garlic and some spices including hing, red chilli, haldi, coriander, ginger are added. There may be a sweet and sour version of dal in some regions. Finally, the boiled daal is added and cooked.</p>
<p>Baati is a hard bread made up of wheat flour commonly known as aata. Wheat flour is kneaded with little bit of salt, dahi (yogurt) and water. Tennis ball-sized round balls of this dough are cooked in a well-heated traditional oven. When the baati becomes golden brown in colour, it is greased with ghee and is then served with dal, rava ladoo, rice, pudina chutney, kairi (raw mango) chutney, green salad with lots of onion, and fresh buttermilk (chass).</p>

					<p>Laal maans is a meat curry from Rajasthan, India. It is a mutton curry prepared in a sauce of yoghurt and hot spices such as red Mathania chillies. This dish typically is very hot and rich in garlic, the gravy may be thick or liquid and is eaten with chapatis made out of wheat (usually eaten in summers) or bajra (a millet grown in Rajasthan and eaten in the winter months).</p>

<p>Chef Bulai Swain said that: "Traditionally, laal maas was made with wild game meat (jungli maas), such as boar or deer and chillies were used to veil the gamy odour of the meat. It was a favourite among the royalties. While the spicy flavour is remained intact now, the meat used is tender mutton</p>

					<div class="col-xs-9">
					<p>Ghevar is a Rajasthani cuisine sweet traditionally associated with the Teej Festival. Besides Rajasthan, it is also famous in the adjoining states of Haryana, Delhi, Gujarat, western Uttar Pradesh, Madhya Pradesh etc.

It is disc-shaped sweet cake made with maida (refined wheat flour) and soaked in sugar syrup. There are many varieties of Ghevar, including plain, mawa and malai ghevar. It is generally prepared in July - August for the Teej or Rakshabandhan festival.</p>

<p>As per ayurveda, the months of Shravan and Bhadrapada i.e. July-August-September are predominated with Vata and Pitta respectively. This causes dryness and acidity in the whole body, resulting in restlessness and mood swings.

The highly sweet and ghee laden Ghevar and Firni provide relief from the acidic and moist environment. They have Vata and Pitta calming properties due to ghee and sweet juice. Thus, they have a calming effect on mind as well as the body</p>

					<div class="col-xs-9">
					<p>Mishti doi is a fermented sweet doi (yogurt) originating from Bengal. It is made with milk and sugar/jaggery. It differs from the plain yogurt because of the technique of preparation.</p>

<p>Mishti doi is prepared by boiling milk until it is slightly thickened, sweetening it with sugar, either gura (brown sugar) or khejur gura (date molasses), and allowing the milk to ferment overnight. Earthenware is always used as the container for making mitha dahi because the gradual evaporation of water through its porous walls not only further thickens the yoghurt, but also produces the right temperature for the growth of the culture. Very often the yoghurt is delicately seasoned with a pinch of cardamom for fragrance. Baked yogurt is a similar preparation in the west.</p>
